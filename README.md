For the final project you will be creating an automated version of the classic card game WAR, using classes and objects.
Here are some tips and suggestions as you proceed:

1. You will create Classes with fields & methods for the following:

- Card
- Deck
- Player

2.  You will create an application class, App, which has a main method and which will use the classes created above to accomplish the goal of this project, instantiating each of the objects as needed.  We suggest one Deck, with 52 Cards, and 2 Players.  Remember to create getters, setters and constructors for each of these.

3.  As your Final Java Project, this assignment will be written in Java, and will use much of what you have learned so far, including variables, loops, methods, classes, instantiation of objects, and more.

4. Start with the basics.  Follow the instructions. 

Remember:  this project is a simple, automated version of the card game WAR.  The idea is to have it run automatically.
